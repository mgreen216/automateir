In the spirit of the popular book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), this workshop will give project-based examples of automating tasks from an Office of Institutional Research using Python. The workshop will utilize a few packages from the Python library. Before the workshop, you'll receive a guide on downloading and running Python on your local machine. During the workshop, we'll review projects, including reading data from a pdf table, automating data processing, writing data to an Excel workbook, and sending reports through email.
