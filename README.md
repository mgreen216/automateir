# Automate the Boring Stuff in IR with Python

In the spirit of the popular book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), this workshop will give project-based examples of automating tasks from an Office of Institutional Research using Python. The workshop will utilize a few packages from the Python library. Before the workshop, you'll receive a guide on downloading and running Python on your local machine. During the workshop, we'll review projects, including reading data from a pdf table, automating data processing, writing data to an Excel workbook, and sending reports through email.

Through participation in this workshop, participants will be able to:
- use Python to read data tables from different sources (Excel, CSV, JSON, HTML, and pdf)
- clean up tables with common data preprocessing techniques (clean extra spaces, change data types, add features, etc.)
- save data tables into an Excel Workbook
- setup a Python script to run on an automated schedule
